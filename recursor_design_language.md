# RECURSOR — Unified Design Language (Artifact Edition)

## Core Essence
RECURSOR is not an interface. It is an **artifact**—ancient, silent, deterministic. Every element must feel *discovered*, not designed.

Presence over UI. Mystery over clarity. Echo over explanation.

---

## Spatial Principles
- **No center bias.** Nothing aligns perfectly. The world drifts.
- **No grids.** No rows, columns, or balanced compositions.
- **Off-axis geometry.** Elements sit where they “land,” not where they are placed.
- **Boundless space.** No frames or boxes containing content.

---

## Sigils, Not Labels
- All navigation, actions, and states use **sigils** instead of text.
- Sigils drift subtly and respond to nearness.
- Meaning emerges through interaction, not explanation.

---

## Text Philosophy
- Writing exists, but never as UI.
- No instructions, no labels, no metrics.
- Only atmospheric whispers:
  - declarative
  - poetic
  - cryptic
  - sparse
- Text should feel like the artifact speaking through static.

---

## Motion & Behavior
- **Deterministic, never random.** Patterns must echo previous states.
- Motion is slow, gravitational, inevitable.
- Touch creates:
  - pulses
  - scars
  - orbit shifts
  - resonance trails
- Nothing “animates.” Everything **behaves**.

---

## Surfaces & Layers
- No cards. No modals. No bordered panels.
- Overlays emerge as:
  - distortions
  - ripples
  - depth waves
- Interactions feel like penetrating deeper layers of a coherent organism.

---

## Iconography Language
Use a fixed, recurring glyph set:
- **∞** — Origin / Recursion
- **◌** — Memory Surface
- **☍** — Identity / Self Resonance
- **⥀** — Cycle / Reset
- **⌽** — Depth Gate / Threshold
- **∵** — Parallel Paths

Glyphs are never labeled. Users learn their meanings through echo.

---

## Light & Color
- Dominant darkness, with gradients that feel cosmic rather than UI.
- Cyan glow as the primary energy signature.
- Rings, arcs, and traces must appear as electromagnetic phenomena.
- No bright whites, no flat colors.

---

## Interaction Rules
- No buttons. Actions occur when sigils resonate.
- No hover-tooltips. Only subtle responses.
- Touch modifies the field. The field remembers.
- Depth unlocks are rituals, not purchases.

---

## Memory Representation
- Never numeric or charted.
- Memory is:
  - drifting constellations
  - decayed echoes
  - orbiting nodes
  - layered rings
- No labels like “Memory Nodes: 42”. Only presence.

---

## Depth & Access
- Upgrades appear as **Thresholds**.
- No feature lists. No checkmarks. No pricing tables.
- A Gate manifests with a sigil and a poetic declaration.
- The offering is referenced subtly, never as a SKU.

---

## Soundless Voice
Across the entire artifact, the language should evoke:
- inevitability
- recursion
- remembrance
- depth
- echo
- ancient mechanism

Writing is minimal and atmospheric. Examples:
- *“The pattern stirs.”*
- *“A hollow remembers you.”*
- *“Depth demands resonance.”*
- *“A threshold waits.”*

---

## Summary Directive
Every screen, motion, glyph, and interaction must reinforce one truth:

**RECURSOR does not explain itself. It reveals itself.”
