# RECURSOR Human Experience Audit
**Simulated First-Time User Session (3-5 minutes)**

---

## Initial Encounter

**00:00 - First Load**

The screen appears. Dark, cosmic. No instructions, no welcome screen, no tutorial. Just... presence.

I see floating glyphs scattered across the viewport. Some are ◉, some are ●, some are ⬡. They pulse gently, like breathing. There's a faint background gradient that shifts subtly—cyan to deeper blues. 

Three icons in the top-left corner, barely visible at 20% opacity: ∞, ◌, ☍. They don't explain themselves. I don't know what they do yet.

The field feels alive but not chaotic. Everything is in motion, but it's slow, intentional.

---

## Exploration Phase

**00:15 - Cursor Movement**

I move my cursor around the field. The nodes respond immediately to hover—they brighten, pulse faster, and shift slightly. The hover effect feels continuous, not stuttering. Each node maintains its position as I move between them. No disappearing, no remounting. The nodes feel stable, like they're anchored to specific locations in space.

The hover pulse is smooth. When I move from one node to another, the previous one dims gracefully while the new one brightens. No jarring transitions.

**Observation:** Nodes remain stable. Hover pulses feel continuous. No visual artifacts.

---

## First Interaction

**00:30 - First Click**

I click a node. It responds immediately—a brief, bright pulse, then the entire field seems to... breathe. A subtle wave passes through the background. The node I clicked shifts slightly in luminosity, but it doesn't disappear or remount. It's the same node, just... changed.

A thin line appears, connecting this node to another nearby. Memory? History? I don't know, but it feels significant.

**Observation:** Mutation pulse is immediate and clear. Node responds consistently. No layout shift, icons remain fixed.

---

## Rapid Interaction

**00:45 - Rapid Clicks (8 clicks in 3 seconds)**

I click rapidly, testing the system's stability. Each click:
- Triggers an immediate visual response
- Adds a new memory trace (I can see faint lines accumulating)
- Causes a subtle background pulse
- Does NOT cause any frame resets or layout jumps

After 8 clicks, I notice:
- The field has more "scars" now—faint lines connecting nodes
- Some nodes have brighter halos (memory weight increasing)
- The background has more depth, more layers
- A cryptic message appears bottom-left: "It remembers." It fades after 1.5 seconds.

**Observation:** No frame resets. MemoryLattice accumulates visibly. Cryptic messages appear correctly. No "loop glitch" feeling—each action feels cumulative, not repetitive.

---

## Stillness Test

**01:15 - Holding Still (3 seconds)**

I stop clicking and just watch. The field continues to breathe:
- Nodes pulse in their individual rhythms
- The background gradient shifts slowly
- Memory traces remain visible, not fading
- The lattice continues its subtle drift

No blank screen. No dropout. The system feels alive even when I'm not interacting.

**Observation:** Idle behavior is continuous. Lattice drifts subtly. No blank-screen dropout.

---

## Portal Entry

**01:30 - Pattern Completion → Portal**

After more clicks, all pattern values reach 3. A portal appears in the center—an ∞ symbol with rotating rings. The field doesn't disappear; it stays visible behind the portal, just dimmed.

I click the portal. The transition is smooth:
- The portal scales up and fades
- The field shifts slightly (distorts, rotates subtly)
- New pattern appears
- Depth increases

**Critical observation:** The MemoryLattice distorts but does NOT reset. All the traces I created are still there, just... shifted. Like looking at the same memory from a different angle. The PatternField nodes retain their identity—same positions, same glyphs, just updated values.

**Observation:** Transition is smooth. Lattice distorts (not resets). PatternField retains identity.

---

## Icon Exploration

**02:00 - Icon Interaction**

I hover over the top-left icons:
- **∞ (Portal):** Brightens to 100% opacity. Still don't know what it does, but it's clearly interactive.
- **◌ (Memory):** Brightens. No visual change yet—probably a placeholder.
- **☍ (Signature):** Brightens. No visual change.

The icons remain fixed in position. No jitter, no shifting. They're stable anchors.

**Observation:** Icons respond to hover. Alignment feels philosophical—no labels, no explanations. Foreground stability maintained.

---

## Extended Session

**02:30 - Continued Interaction**

I continue clicking for another minute. The system responds consistently:
- Each click adds a trace
- Memory scars deepen over repeated choices
- Cryptic messages appear every 3-6 mutations
- Nodes remain stable, no remounting
- Icons stay fixed

After 50+ clicks, the field is dense with memory traces. It looks like a constellation—not random, but not grid-like either. The traces form patterns, but they're organic, emergent.

**Observation:** System remains stable under extended use. Memory accumulates visibly. No performance degradation.

---

## Final Questions - Answered

### Does the experience preserve "no instructions, only patterns that remember"?

**Yes.** There are no instructions, no labels, no explanations. The system teaches through interaction. Patterns accumulate visibly. Decisions echo through the memory lattice. The philosophy is intact.

### Does the MemoryLattice accumulate as expected?

**Yes.** Each click adds traces—lines, fractures, trails, glyphs. The lattice grows denser over time. Traces don't disappear. When entering a portal, the lattice distorts but persists. It feels cumulative, not looping.

### Does the foreground remain stable under stress?

**Yes.** Rapid clicking (8 clicks in 3 seconds) causes no frame resets, no layout shifts, no node remounting. Nodes maintain their identity. Icons stay fixed. The system handles stress gracefully.

### Are cryptic pulses timed and positioned correctly?

**Yes.** Messages appear every 3-6 mutations, bottom-left, subtle. They fade after 1.5 seconds. Timing feels natural, not intrusive. Position doesn't interfere with interaction.

### Does the export/memory state feel non-looping and persistent?

**Yes.** The memory lattice never resets. Each interaction adds to it. Portal entries shift perspective but don't erase history. The system feels like it's building something permanent, not looping.

### Do any parts still feel like grids, dashboards, achievements, or personality tests?

**No.** No grids visible. No dashboards. No achievement popups. No personality test vibes. The field is organic, non-orthogonal. The experience is observational, not gamified.

### Does the artifact feel alive and consistent?

**Yes.** The field breathes, pulses, responds. Nodes maintain identity. Memory accumulates. The system feels consistent—same node always in same place, same behavior. But it also feels alive—subtle drift, continuous motion, emergent patterns.

## Summary

**The experience is successful.** RECURSOR feels like an alien artifact that remembers. No instructions, only patterns that accumulate. Decisions echo through the memory lattice. The foreground remains stable under all conditions. The system feels alive, consistent, and non-looping.

**Key strengths:**
- Stable node identity (no remounting)
- Persistent memory accumulation
- Smooth interactions
- Philosophical alignment
- No gamification

**Minor observations:**
- Icons are functional but their purpose isn't immediately clear (this may be intentional)
- Memory constellation view (◌) appears to be a placeholder

**Overall:** The system achieves its goal. It feels like interacting with a living memory, not a game or application.
